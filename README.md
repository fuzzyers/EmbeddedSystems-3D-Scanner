# EmbeddedSystems-3D-Scanner
3D Scanner Project for Image Modeling

## Plan

### Equipment
- [x] Need Camera Module Either Raspberry Pi or Arduino (Raspberry Pi) *ordered
- [x] External Power for Stepper Motor
- [x] Need Bigger Stepper Motor (defunct) *using small and light turntable

### Model
- [x] Build Model to house camera
- [X] Build Model to house turntable
- [ ] Optional Led Screen and Joystick 
- [ ] print
- [X] Gears (to geardown)

### Program Basic Functionality
- [ ] Program Arduino to take photos or Raspberry Pi
- [X] Program Arduino to turn stepper motor.
- [x] Program Arduino and Raspberry Pi to talk to eachother
- [ ] Program Led Screen to have a start button
- [ ] Joystick For either navigation or starting (optional).

### Program Advanced
- [ ] Program arduino to turn when the pi says so
- [ ] Run Python Script on button press

### Manual testing
- [ ] Test Adding Photos into Regard3d
- [ ] Tweak Settings

### Image Testing (Defunct going to use Raspberyy Pi for Imaging)
- [ ] Work on sending photos to raspberrypi if on arduino

### Raspberry Pi advanced testing
- [ ] Try To render model on raspberry pi 
- [ ] if succesful in reasonable time
- [ ] work on getting them to import and render from the led screen

### Alternative Method
otherwise attempt to use a remote computer and import them and render them there
and send them back.
